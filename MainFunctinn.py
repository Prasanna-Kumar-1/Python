# Knowing the value of the __name__ variable is important to write code that serves the dual purpose of (1)
# executable script and (2) importable module.

# __name__ takes on different values depending on how you executed your Python file. __name__ will be equal to:

# (1) "__main__" when the file is executed from the command line or with python -m (to execute a packageâ€™s __main__.py file)
# (2) The name of the module, if the module is being imported

# Example of having main() execute other functions
from time import sleep

print("This is my file to demonstrate best practices.")
